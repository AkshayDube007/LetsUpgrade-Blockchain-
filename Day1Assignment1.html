    <h5>Solution to Day01 Assignment Question is as given below:</h5>
    <h3>Question 01</h3>
    <h1>1. What is your understanding of Blockchain?</h1>
    <p>Blockchain is a technology which has been evolved mainly in the banking sectors to overcome some issues which many of the banking sectors have been facing before. It makes use of 2 concepts (i-e) distributed systems and cryptography.</p>
        <p>1. Cryptography was started from 1900BC</p>
        <p>2. It is like a one-way encryption (i-e) every data will have their own fingerprint or id so that all dataâ€™s will be having a chain of connections with each other.</p>
        <p>3. Distributed database was started from 1970s</p>
        <p>4. It is the process of storing same data in different places. So that even the data gets corrupted, it can be brought from another place.</p>
<h1>2. What is the core problem, Blockchain trying to solve?</h1>
<p>Normally in any type of transaction has middle men/agents in the transaction and due to this there is a risk of information getting transmitted to other parties. Blockchain solves this problem as it's an encrypted, secure, decentralized form of network and this is the core problem that Blockchain is solving today.</p>
<p>The core problems that Blockchain solves</p>
<p>1. No Hacking</p>
<p>2. Huge Security boost</p>
<p>3. Verifiable</p>
<p>4. Data Transparency</p>
<p>5. Decentralisation of authority to keey the data safe</p>
<h1>3. Whar are the few features that Blockchain will give you?</h1>
<p>Blockchain is a mix of technology having "DISTRIBUTED DATABASE" & "CRYPTOGRAPHY" used together 
    to create much wanted transparency and trust in the system by eradicating middle man.
</p>
<p>It delivers below mentioned features:</p>
<p>Verifiable - It basically inspects who in the community is figuring unwanted issues to access the data 
    and makes that block to retrieve the data from the other blocks chained with it.
</p>
<p>Unchangeable - The data secured with blockchain concept is unchangeable as it is been strored/accessed by numerous systems.</p>
<p>Tamper-proof - The SHA- Hash key for each block wherein you data is stored makes it tamper-proof.</p>
<p>Immutable - Its immposible of alter/modify the data chained in a block of Blockchain.</p>
<h1>4. What all things does a Block contains?</h1>
<p>Block contains the below information: </p>
<ul>Block Number.</ul>   
<ul>Previous Block Key - "0" in case its the Genesis Block{1st Block in the chain}.</ul>
<ul>Record of the data - Your database/information.</ul>
<ul>Mining Key</ul>
<h1>5. How is Verifiablity of Blockchain can be attained?</h1>
<p>Verification in blockchain is a consensus mechanism based process.
    Since blockchain acts as a decentralized ledger with multiple nodes in the
    network, the transaction must be verified by all nodes.</p>
<p>The transactions in a blockchain are referred to by their hash.</p>
<p>The Blockchain can be verifiability by the data and the key that are stored in
    the distributed systems.</p>
<ul>Block 1 = A+B = C
    Block 2 = B+D = F</ul>
    <p>Where,
    A is Genesis Block,which doesn't have a previous blocks signature.
    B & D are data to be stored.
    C & F are Signatures.</p>
